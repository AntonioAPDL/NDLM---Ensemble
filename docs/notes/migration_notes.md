# Migration Notes

- Original repository had a single raw file (`main.tex`) containing mixed markdown-like derivation notes.
- The raw source was preserved verbatim at `archive/main_raw_2026-02-07.md`.
- Derivations were restructured into sectioned LaTeX files under `docs/derivations/sections/`.
- Gaussian NDLM semantics were preserved; equations were rewritten into compilable LaTeX with explicit labels and domains.
